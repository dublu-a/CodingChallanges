This is inspired by Daniel Shiffman's youtube series : [Coding Challanges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRMlist=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH).


# Build instructions

This project uses `xmake` as a build system so you don't have to worry about depedencies.

Just run the following command to build the entire project:

```console
$ xmake build
```

And this one to run one of the challanges:

```console
$ xmake run <challange-name>
```

NOTE(Andrei): not providing `<challange-name>` will result in running all the challanges one after the other
